Given this part in the prompt:
>Test datasets will not contain any direct identifiers (DIDs).

I will avoid looking for strings that resemble names, emails, or other contact info.

Reviewing the squirrel sample data, a few things are evident:

*Date*
Date is stored as an int with MMDDYYYY as the format. 

Dates are limited to the month of October. As an int, I'd assume that other, broader
datasets wouldn't include leading 0's, since they would only be possible on the
day of month, but not the month (eg 6052019 vs 652019). 

This is a gnarly way to store dates (certainly wouldn't happen in our warehouse)
and precludes me from doing inteligent date rounding via week, month, quarter, decade truncs.

Given additional time, a set of helper functions for detecting dates in all the 
inventive formats someone may choose to store them would be handy.

*Hectare*
This appears to be a categorical mapping column. Again, a more intelligent rounding 
approach would be preferable, but it's unclear what other test datasets would present.

My rounding approach heavily distorts the data. Doing a group on this and mapping back to
a mode rather than keeping the truncated value would have been better.

*Age* *Primary Fur Color* *Highlight Fur Color* *Location*
Each contain copious nulls. Going to fill these with some solid guesses

For categorical columns, we'll use the mode. For continuous vars, we'll go for the median

We then use the remaining QIDs to group and check for slim categories (<3 samples)

On those entries, we run kmeans clustering to bucket them into like groups and 
distort the data by taking a mean of the QIDs to represent the sample accross the whole
cluster
